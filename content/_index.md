I am an undergraduate and [coterminal master's student][coterm] in computer
science minoring in mathematics at [Stanford University][]. My undergraduate and graduate
specializations are in systems programming and theoretical computer science,
respectively.

I enjoy working in both of these areas within both practical and academic
contexts, 

Please reach out to me by [email][] if you want to chat, or check out my
(slightly out of date) [resume][].

### Research

My specific interests lie in programming language theory, category theory, and
mathematical logic. I research in the area of [secure][seccomp1]
[compilation][seccomp2] under the advisement of [Marco Patrignani][]. See our
[POPL '21 paper][mu-expr-arxiv] on the relative expresiveness of different mechanisms for
enabling divergence in the simply-typed lambda calculus.

Expressiveness of Recursive Types"

### Interests / Hobbies / Things

I study classical flute and love listening to classical music---in particular
the works of J. S. Bach, Mahler, Ravel, Shostakovich, and Sibelius.

I am a reader of creative non-fiction, philosophical texts, textbooks, and
research literature.

From time to time I enjoy soldering and programming embedded systems on
Raspberry Pis or [SiFive] RISC boards.
